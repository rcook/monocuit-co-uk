	'<p id="blogParagraph">Hello and welcome to my website. I am a thirty-four year old (Trainee) Software Developer, part-time Computing student and father. I''m from, and live, in Bradford which is in Yorkshire, in the north of England.</p><p id="blogParagraph">In my teens and early twenties it was often said of me that if I were any more relaxed I''d be horizontal. I was certainly far less stressed and, perhaps more significantly, irritable than I am now and, whilst I have no desire to become as wasteful and lax as I was then, I would certainly like to regain some of that ability to unwind and simply let go.</p><p id="blogParagraph">Over the last few weeks and months I have taken a step back from modern life and started the process of examining it to see what is really important to me. I have come to some conclusions which I feel put me at odds with the general consensus. This is not to say that I believe my personal revelations to be particularly revolutionary, since at the moment I do not have either the clarity or certainty in my newfound feelings to convince anyone else. They are just feelings for now.</p><p id="blogParagraph">I feel that I am part of a materially wealthy but emotionally bereft society. A society built on a false, insidious premise. A premise which divides on both a global and local scale and erodes our natural instincts and drives.</p><p id="blogParagraph">The good thing is, however, that individuals have the ability to reprogram themselves, and this is the process I have started. It''s a fundamental re-evaluation.</p>',
